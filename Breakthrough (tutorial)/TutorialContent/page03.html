		We are now going to make our game <b>objects</b>. Objects are the resource that we use to control aspects of a game and to do specific things. They can be given a sprite, have behaviours, and they can be instructed to react to certain game events as well as to each other. 
		
	<p>
		So, let's make our first object! This object is going to be for the "bricks" that we want our player to break. To create this, go ahead and right-click <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="Icon_RMB.png"> on the <b>Objects</b> resource in the resource tree and select "Create Object". This will open up the Object Editor:
		
			<img class="center" src="03_01_Create_Object.png" alt="The Object Editor">
			
	<p>
		In the "Name" section give the object the name "obj_Brick", then click the button labelled "<i>No Sprite</i>". This will open the <b>Asset Explorer</b> where you can select the brick sprite that you drew previously:
		
			<img class="center" src="03_02_AddSprite.gif" alt="Adding A Sprite To An Object">

	<p>
		We don't need to change any other properties for this object, and can now move on to adding some <b>Events</b>. An Event is simply a moment within the game loop when something happens. The main ones are:
		
		<ul>
			<li><b>Create</b>: This is triggered the first time an instance of the object is created in a room and is where you would initialise variables and set values etc...</li><br>
			<li><b>Step</b>: Each game step (or frame) this event will be triggered, and it's where you would place the majority of the objects logic</li><br>
			<li><b>Draw</b>: This is where things are drawn. If you have no code in this event, then <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> will automatically draw whatever sprite is assigned to the object</li><br>
			<li><b>Destroy</b>: This event is only triggered when an instance of the object is destroyed (removed from the room) and can be used for a variety of tasks like creating an explosion, or adding score, or playing a sound, etc...</li><br>
		</ul>
		
	<p>
		For more detailed information on all of the events that an object can have, please <a href="gms2tutorials:///ShowHelp?tag=events">see the manual</a>.
		
	<p>
		In the case of our brick object, we will need to use the <b>Create Event</b> only (for now), so in the Event window, click the <i>Add Event</i> button and select <b>Create</b>. This event will now be added and a code window will open up ready for you to add your code to it. In this case we want to add the following:
		
	<p class="code">
		/// @description Set Colour<br>
		image_blend = choose(c_red, c_yellow, c_blue, c_green, c_fuchsia, c_orange);<br>
	</p>
	
			<img class="center" src="03_03_BrickCreate.png" alt="Brick Object Create Event">

	<p>
		The <tt>image_blend</tt> variable is a built-in variable that controls the colour to be blended with the object sprite. In this case we are telling <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> to choose from one of six colours, and this will make our bricks all be different colours when they are created in a room.
		
	<p>
		With that done, you can close the Object Editor for the brick, and we can move on to creating the ball object...
